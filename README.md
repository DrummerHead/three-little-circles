# Three Little Circles - d3 tutorial

Original article at http://mbostock.github.io/d3/tutorial/circle.html but since it had some errors and was not running, I fixed it here :)

Works locally without fetching external files, good for studying on the road.

All work is originally from [@mbostock](https://github.com/mbostock/)
